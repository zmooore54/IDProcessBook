<h4>Background Research</h4>
<hr style="width:36%;border:1px solid #E6C344" class="w3-round">

<p> Before starting our research we spent some time looking into the existing resources available to lonely students.
  We identified three primary services students can use to combat loneliness: counseling, events, and specialty apps. </p>
  <p> The benefit of a student engaging with the counseling center is they can have a safe space to meet with a licensed
  professional at no cost to them. While this is helpful, some students are hesitant to get started with counseling because
  of the social stigma associated with therapy. </p>
  <p> Campus events aim to build community between students, but when a student tends to be
  more introverted or prefer smaller social settings these can be overwhelming an not effective. </p>
  <p>Some campuses, like the University of Maryland, have developed apps that help students monitor their mental health through periodic
  check-ins, but these systems have the tendency to overwhelm students.</p>

<br>

  <h4>Target Users</h4>
  <hr style="width:20%;border:1px solid #E6C344" class="w3-round">

  <p> While loneliness affects many members of society, college age students experience loneliness in unique ways because
    of the unusual circumstances and pressures on them. Through this study we aimed to better understand the factors these users
    face to get a better picture of how loneliness fits into their lives and where we can implement a design to reduce their loneliness.</p>

		<p><center>Loneliness can be defined as the gap between someone’s desire for connection and the reality of their connections.
      Through our project we aimed to account for how a specific group in society, college age students, are affected by loneliness and
      design a way to reduce its impact.</center></p>

<h4>Research Method Design</h4>
<hr style="width:40.5%;border:1px solid #E6C344" class="w3-round">

<p>In order to triangulate our data, we decided to use three methods of data collection: an initial survey, a time diary study, and de-brief
  interviews. The survey was used to help us get an initial understanding of our users’ loneliness, the time diary study showed us specific ways
  our user’s experience loneliness, and the debrief interviews helped us unpack those specific instances and emotions. We used these three methods
  to get a well rounded view of how loneliness fits into and affects our users.</p>

<br>



<h4>Data Collection Methods</h4>
<hr style="width:40%;border:1px solid #E6C344" class="w3-round">

<h5>Survey</h5>
<p>The first step in our study was to conduct an initial survey. We distributed this survey to five universities on both the east and west coasts,
  and were able to collect responses from 21 individuals. We asked the participants some demographic information, questions about their current
  social environments, and four main questions about their loneliness levels.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>How often do you feel left out?</li>
    <li>How often do you feel isolated?</li>
    <li>How often do you feel lonely?</li>
    <li>How often do you feel like you have no one to talk to?</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <img src="img/survey1.png" style="width:100%">

    <div class="column">

    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <img src="img/survey4.png" style="width:100%">
    </div>
  </div>
<p>There was also a free space where participants could elaborate on their answers to these questions. The data collected from this survey gave
  us a better sense of the way our target audience currently experiences loneliness. Additionally, we found that participants gave a lot of great
  insight in these free spaces, so we made sure to include this feature when building our time diary tool.</p>

<br>






<br>

<h5>Time Diary</h5>
<p>The diary study was the next step in our research process. This portion consisted of 10 participants and was used to get a day by day detailing
  of each person’s daily routine and the points in their day that they experience loneliness the most. We wanted to see if there was any correlation
  between their daily activities/stressors and their levels of loneliness. Based on our initial research and our screener questionnaire, we felt that a
  person’s loneliness was often dependent on what the person was doing on that particular day. Our rationale for a daily diary study with check-ins every
  four hours was that it would give us the best and most full picture of that person’s feelings and emotions throughout the day and at each activity.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</center>

<br><br><br>

<h5>De-Brief Interviews</h5>
<p>The last step was to conduct debrief interviews. This was essential to get a deeper understanding on the logic behind our participants answers
  as well as figuring out what coping mechanisms they use. We thought that by adding in a debrief interview we would be able to triangulate our
  data and get a holistic view of how loneliness fits into our participants lives. In our debrief interview with participants we discussed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Their highest loneliness activities</li>
  <li>Their coping methods for loneliness</li>
  <li>Activities where they felt the least lonely</li>
  <li>Their responses to the initial screener survey questions</li>
  <li>If there any services they wish were available for you on campus (or off campus) to help cope with loneliness</li>
  <li>Their response to our questions about counseling services in the initial screener survey</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
<h4>Data Analysis</h4>
<hr style="width:22%;border:1px solid #E6C344" class="w3-round">

<p>Before speaking with each participant we reviewed their initial questionnaire and their time diary profile.
  We were then able to use their information to ask them personalized questions about their unique feelings of loneliness
  and the causes and pressures that affected them.</p>
<p>When the study was over we were able to take the data from the study and build out individual profiles for each user.
  We gave each participant their own excel sheet and aggregated all their data from the time diary in one place. We were then
  able to see how their loneliness progressed through the week and what activities were reported as most lonely. We were also
  able to flip through the profiles and see what activities registered as the most lonely across all participants. We found there
  was three main activities that reported the highest levels of loneliness: <i>netflix, meals, and free time</i>.</p>
<p>After each interview, we conducted debrief sessions with our team and were able to start noticing patterns across our series of
  interviews. Specifically, we started noticing that while each user had a unique setting, there was patterns across the board in
  the various triggers and coping mechanisms.</p>
<br>
<h4>Research Results</h4>
<hr style="width:28%;border:1px solid #E6C344" class="w3-round">

<p>In our research we found three common triggers of loneliness in our group of participants:</p>
<ol>
  <li>People experience loneliness in between activities more than during the activities themselves.</li>
  <li>People experience loneliness when there is a lull in activity.</li>
  <li>People experience loneliness when they’re in a new situation. </li>
</ol>

<h6>“It’s difficult being in a different environment” <br>
- U8 on their transition into graduate school</h6>

<br>
<p>Additionally, we noticed three common coping mechanisms for loneliness:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Watching media (netflix, hulu, youtube) to fill empty time</li>
  <div class="w3-main" style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">
    <h6>“I have a busy schedule and when there is a lull in my day I begin to feel lonely so I like to watch hulu or youtube to fill my time” -U10</h6>
    <br>
  </div>
  <li>Being busy or unproductive</li>
  <div class="w3-main" style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">
    <h6>"When I’m studying I don't have the mental space for loneliness.The productivity is positive and the loneliness doesn’t creep in." - U6</h6>
    <br>
  </div>
  <li>Reaching out to friends for meals.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is from these conclusions that we drew inspiration for our design ideas.</p>

<br>

<h4>Personas</h4>
<hr style="width:15%;border:1px solid #E6C344" class="w3-round">

<p>We built two personas based on the data that we gathered. These personas helped our team in the ideation stage of design by being a
  consolidated representation of our research findings.</p>

<h4>Design Ideation</h4>
<hr style="width:27%;border:1px solid #E6C344" class="w3-round">

<p>The design process began with ideation, 20 sketches were created by each team members for a total of 60 sketches. These sketches were
   developed based on the knowledge gained from our previous research. Below are some examples of sketches that we made as well as the sketch
   that inspired our final idea to begin prototyping. </p>
   <br><br>
   <center><img src="img/sketches.png" style="width:90%"></center>
   <br><br>
<p>To narrow down and consolidate our sketches we grouped them together by theme and then employed a digital dot voting method to decide on a
  final design idea. The final two ideas were 1) an availability application to show when someone is free to hang out and 2) a collaborative
  show-watching application.</p>
<p>Ultimately our team voted to build a collaborative show-watching application because we believed this could be a unique way to connect people
  who are not in person with each other. The application could provide a channel of asynchronous communication, and capitalized on feedback that
  we had received from our interviews and diary studies.</p>
<div class="w3-main" style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">
<h6>“I feel like loneliness stems from an emotional state when I want to talk to someone but I don’t have anyone to talk to.” - U10 on
  wanting to connect with people who aren’t near her</h6>
</div>
<br>
<p>Some form of visual entertainment (netflix, youtube, movies) was mentioned in 9 of the 10 respondents, by integrating an asynchronous
  communication into our app we can help friends connect to one another even when they are not physically able to. In the following section
  we discuss our prototype and our design rationale.</p>


<br>
<h4>Idea Convergence</h4>
<hr style="width:30%;border:1px solid #E6C344" class="w3-round">

<p>After narrowing down our big picture design ideas, we started to think through how we could effectively approach and build a
  collaborative entertainment experience. While we had a big picture idea of what we wanted to build, there was a lot of fine grain
  details we needed to think through.</p>
<p>The first step we took was to look through the design ideas we did not select, and see what features and principles we could incorporate
  into this final idea. We also spent a lot of time sifting back through our interviews to see what features would address the problems
  associated with loneliness and entertainment. We decided on incorporating three main parts into the application: asynchronous comments,
  watch live, and friends availability status. </p>
<br>

<h4>Prototyping</h4>
<hr style="width:19%;border:1px solid #E6C344" class="w3-round">

<p>After we decided on the direction we wanted to take our solution as well as the main parts of our application, we went through various
  steps in the prototyping phase. We created a low fidelity prototype, performed usability testing, applied the results in a medium fidelity
  prototype and then created the final product.</p>
  <h5>Low Fidelity</h5>
    <p>When we began working on our initial prototype, we began brainstorming how we wanted all of our parts to come together. We decided that we
      wanted to achieve the following goals through our design:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Creating an intuitive experience with great learnability potential</li>
      <li>Making it easy for people to connect with their friends</li>
      <li>Have the ability to fully customize their experience without it feeling overwhelming with too many options</li>
    </ol>
<p>With those goals in mind we went straight to the whiteboard and mapped out the important features we would need to create a finished
   project that met those objectives.</p>

<br>
<center>
  <img src="img/brainstorming.png" style="width:90%">
</center>

<br>
<p>We then drew out our prototype on the whiteboard to iterate on the layouts and user flow and simply translated it to a paper prototype.</p>
<br>

<h5>Usability Testing</h5>
<p>After we created our low-fidelity prototype we performed one pilot test. This was a full run through of the prototype to see if there were any
  problems with our technique as well as to get practice conducting a test. </p>

  <br>
  <center><img src="img/paperproto.png" style="width:70%"></center>


  <br>
  <p>We also performed three official usability tests. These tests were
  conducted so we could receive feedback on our design, identify pain points, and make necessary improvements.</p>

  <br>
  <center><img src="img/paperproto2.png" style="width:100%"></center>


  <br>

<p>We received some positive feedback: </p>
<div class="w3-main" style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">
<h6>“I think this is a good idea and it is so exciting that you can do this with people, I really like the idea and everything happening so far” -User Tester 1 </h6>
<h6>“I would use this service because I like to talk to people about tv shows I enjoy. I think with current shows this really comes into play” -User Tester 2 </h6>
<h6>“I would probably use this with my long distance boyfriend, college friends, and grad school friends” -User Tester 3</h6>
</div>
<br>

<p>And we received some helpful critiques: </p>
<div class="w3-main" style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">
<h6>"In regards to the settings option I would change the hierarchy of the way things are displayed” -User Tester 1 </h6>
<h6>“How would I invite friends to watch a show while I’m watching that show? I wouldn’t want to have to leave my show in
  order to perform that action.” -User Tester 2</h6>
<h6>“I would really like the option to let my friend know why I declined her watch invite, I don’t want to be rude” -User Tester 3</h6>
</div>
<br>

    <div class="columnh">
      <img src="img/usertest2.png" style="width:90%">
    </div>
  </div>
</center>


<br>

<p>Taking these comments into consideration, we made many changes to our final low-fidelity prototype by applying the changes that we
  thought would transform our users experience. We used this updated low-fi prototype to create our medium fidelity prototype.</p>

  <br>
  <center><img src="img/finalpaperproto.png" style="width:100%"></center>



<br><br><br>
<h5>Wireframes and Medium Fidelity</h5>
<p>We divided our prototype into three sections, and each wireframed our given section. After the wireframes were complete, we created a styleguide
  with our color palette, typeface, the way our assets would look such as the shape of buttons, etc and began working on designing our final product.
<br><br>


<center><img src="img/styleguide.png" style="width:70%"></center>


<br><br><br>

<h5>Wireframes</h5>
<p>We wireframed our product to set a roadmap and create a standard so everyone in the group knew the overall design plan</p>

  <h4>What Did We Learn?</h4>
  <hr style="width:32%;border:1px solid #E6C344" class="w3-round">

  <p>We received a lot of great feedback from all three of our usability tests. We learned that although our application is something that our
    users would use, there are some interactive aspects that would definitely need fine tuning before moving to the next step. We thought deeply
    about how certain interactions would take place such as how users would add and find friends or how the two variations of watching should be
    displayed.</p>
  <p>Secondly, users never seem committed to one choice and we learned that we need to give them the capability to easily change the options they
    have selected no matter where they are in the process of using the app. Whether they’re in the main menu or watching a show, we’ve made sure
    that vital settings such as inviting friends to watch or muting comments can be done at any point in the experience.</p>
  <p>Through the tests we conducted it became apparent that our users have a lot of expectations when it comes to an entertainment app. They already have a
    mental model of where tools should be and how features should work, when these things were out of place it distracted them from the content
    and goal. We learned that while our product is a unique idea, it does draw heavily on the user’s previous experiences with entertainment
    platforms and we kept that in mind when designing features and flows.</p>
